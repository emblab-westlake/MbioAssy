## MbioAssy2.0

### Update
The MbioAssy2.0 adds two function modules based on MbioAssy1.0:
* 3_iCAMP.R: quantify relative importance of basic community assembly processes at phylogenetic group level.
* 5.2_RMT_Co-occurrence_network.R: add the function to find the optimized correlation threshold instead of the 'cut-off' value based on the RMT theory.  

The document was updated by ZZ on June 27 2023, and by JF on Feburary 21st, 2024.

### This folder contains R scripts for microbial community assembly analyses, including NST calculation, neutral model analysis, iCAMP null model analysis, C-score variance analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and generation of random newtorks.

input files includes:  
a) OTU table of microbial entities (e.g., OTUs, ASVs), each row is an OTU, each column is a sample.  
b) Group table indicating the grouping infprmation of samples.  
c) Taxonomy table of microbia entities (e.g., OTUs, ASVs), each row is an OTU, seven columns corresponding to the taxonomy classification of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.  
d) A phylogenetic tree constructed using the OTUs or ASVs.  
e) Environment table indiacting the phygeochemical variables of samples.  

Note: Time-series data or local scale samples are recommended for the analyses, but samples with large spatial scale or heterogeneities may lead to bias.
      

### Functions:
### 1_NST.R
This script uses a developed R package NST (Reference doi:10.1073/pnas.1904623116) to calculate NST (normalized stochasticity ratio), which range from 0 to 100% and provides quantitative assessment of ecological stochasticity based on null model. A larger NST represents the community is more affected by stochasticity.

### 2_Neutral_model.R
This script was modified from (Reference doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.142) and used to compare observed community composition with that predicted by a neutral assembly model(Reference doi:10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00956.x),which assumes that community assembly is only driven by chance and dispersal.The results were output as a visualized figure and a detailed table which contains information of observed and predicted community composition.

### 3_iCAMP.R
This script was modified from (Reference doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18560-z) and used to quantify relative importance of basic community assembly processes at phylogenetic group ('bin') levels. The results were output as a detailed table which contains the relative importance of the five processes: homogeneous selection, heterogeneous selection, homoginizing dispersal, dispersal limitation, and drift.

### 4_C-score-var.R

This script was for the checkerboard score variance(C-score-var) analysis of non-random species co-occurrence patterns. Cite:

### 5.1_Co-occurrence_network.R
This script first defines the function "co_occurrence_network" to generate a filtered gml-formatted network file based on all pairwise Spearman's correlations and FDR-adjusted P-value calculation and filtration, and then uses input abundance table to generate co-occurrence network which can be further visulized and explored in Gephi (https://gephi.org/) or Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/).

### 5.2_RMT_Co-occurrence_network.R
Based on the '5.1_Co-occurrence_network.R' script, this script adds the function to find the optimized correlation threshold instead of the 'cut-off' value based on the RMT theory.
